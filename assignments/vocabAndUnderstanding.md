# Concepts and Understanding

This will cover all the material that we covered on the 18th. This assignment isn't due until Tuesday night on the last week of class, so please take your time.

Discuss concepts with cohorts in the Discord, and use any other resources available to answer the questions to the best of your ability, and ask the Instructor if you're still stuck.

Do your best to not copy and paste answers, I'm not looking for word-for-word definitions, I'm looking for you to convey your understanding of concepts.

## 1. What is cloud computing

Briefly explain what the cloud is, two pros, and two cons to using the cloud.

## 2. Virtualization

Please explain, in high-level terms, what a hypervisor is, how many types there are, and what the difference between the types are.

> Extra credit: What is a container? Provide how it's different from a hypervisor, or what it's general use case is.

## 3. Cloud Computing Models

Consider a situation where you want to orchestrate a theatre play about a duck undercover in a flock of geese.
Please use this resources guide for orchestrating your play:

- Auditorium
- Stage
- Audience seating
- Set (Stage scenery/buildings i.e. "Stage Set")
- Actors
- Props
- Play Program
- Script

For each of the concepts below, please say which of the components or resources would be provided and what your experience would be in orchestrating the play.

- 3.a) If you were to rent an IaaS solution?
- 3.b) If you were to utilize a PaaS solution?
- 3.c) If you were to use a SaaS solution?

## 4. Security Concepts

Using section's 6 and 7, the provided PDF in blackboard, plus any additional online resources you want, please choose 2 of the Egregious 11 security concerns and write a few sentences on what the security issue is (without pasting directly from any source), and at least one way to combat the security issue.

I personally recommend Data Breaches and Account Hijacking.
